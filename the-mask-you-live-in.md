Notes/Quotes from the film.

Everyone deserves to feel whole.  And each of us can do our part in expanding what it means to be a man.

Society needs men to get into their hearts and out of their head.  

There is freedom outside of these rigid definitions of manhood.

We need to re-define strength in men NOT as power over other people BUT as forces for justice.  And justice means fairness and equality for all.  It means working against violence.  And we need more men willing to speak out even when there is a risk to go into male culture and make other men uncomfortable.  We need men to use their prvilage to be part of the solution. It's not about teaching boys something new.  It is about helping boys stay with or return to what they already know.  Support, caring and compassion don't belone to men or women.  They are human patterns. 

We need to break down the systems of emotional constriction that lead to so many men having lives of quiet desperation, depression, alcoholism.  It's important for elders to give permission to our sons to process grief, to give permission to cry so they can develop all of their emotions so you do away with not knowing where to go with your own pain.

Whatever Dad's do with their sons is masculine whether its cooking or flying a kite.

We need to challenge men and boys to rise to the better angels of their nature with the best aspirations that they have for themselves as human beings and as men.  I think that's a positive challenge and many men can rise to that challenge.

Everyone in a boys life should help the boy stay true to who they are so they don't have to wear a mask.
