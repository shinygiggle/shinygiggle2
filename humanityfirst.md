Humanity First
==============

### Put the care for others first before moving onto business

Catch it before it drifts
=========================

### We catch even the smallest issues before they become larger, including interpersonal conflicts

Be here now
===========

### Be present with the people around you

Take stock & celebrate the wins
===============================

### We make time to slow down, reflect and celebrate what we have achieved

Do your work
============

### Take responsibility for your personal wellbeing, prepare effectively for meetings and other events and be prepared to do the work on yourself so you can become a better person

Get it done
===========

### Be resilient and focused under pressure so that you achieve the outcomes you set out to

Take the shot
=============

### Back yourself and be proactive

Be a springboard
================

### Support others to bounce back up when they take a shot and it misses
